# Concrete_Strength_prediction
The model predicts the compressive strength (MPa) of concrete based on ingredients like cement, water, slag, and age.  I trained a ReLU-based neural network, saved the model in PyTorch, and deployed it in a Streamlit app so users can input mix values and instantly get predictions.  This project helped me understand model training, saving in PyTorch
